round_table
===========

App for managing round tables (google hangouts).

First step is to write embeddable html button which opens google hangout (round table).
The google hangout app will send data to round_table server.
This way when another person joins the hangout, the button will send it to already existing hangout.

Second step is to divide uses by language (let them select).
Third step, write embeddable html table with data about all users and all round tables.
